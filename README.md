# Linux_kernel_module_about_strom_controll

This is a linux kernel module about storm controll. </n>
There are no linux function to prevent strom in network at present.
Howebver, this function is needed in linux because of using linux as a general server.
Therefore, I try to implement this function as a linux kernel module.
