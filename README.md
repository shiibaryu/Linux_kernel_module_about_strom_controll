# strom_controll

"now developing" <br>
This is a linux kernel module about storm controll. <br>
There are no linux function to prevent strom in network at present.<br>
Howebver, this function is needed in linux because of using linux as a general server.<br>
Therefore, I try to implement this function as a linux kernel module.<br>
