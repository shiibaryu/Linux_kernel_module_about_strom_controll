# Traffic Strom Control module for Linux
This is a linux kernel module about storm control. <br>
There are no linux function to prevent storm in network at present.<br>
Howebver, this function is needed in linux because of using linux as a general server.<br>
Therefore, I try to implement this function as a linux kernel module.<br>
